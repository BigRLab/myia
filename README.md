* **Array type**: For user-friendliness and type safety we want built-in array types. Theano and TensorFlow both support gradual typing (shapes can be optionally given) with type inference, although more formal and extensive type systems which include shape types, symmetric matrices, etc. would be better.
* **GPU support**: For performance reasons we want to be able to use parallel architectures e.g. GPUs through CUDA
* **Reverse-mode AD**: Deep learning research relies heavily on calculating gradients for functions with large input spaces
* **Python integration**: Python is the go-to programming language for scientists, with a huge number of libraries that can be used for visualization, data preprocessing, etc.
* **Control flow statements**: Although libraries like Theano and TensorFlow have support for control flow, it is in the form of function calls instead of statements. Moreover, some support (e.g. `continue` and `break` statements) is missing, and the internal representation of control flow (such as loops) limits and complicates the optimizing compiler.
* **Optimizing compiler**: For high-performance and portability a pipeline involving code generation for potentially multiple backends is preferred over an interpreted language
* **Optimizing numerical stability**: Since the program formulation is intended to be more mathematical than numerical, we want our compiler to optimize for numerical stability
