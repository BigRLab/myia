"""Parse a Python AST into the Myia graph-based ANF IR.

Graph construction proceeds very similarly to the way that FIRM constructs its
SSA graph [1]_. The correspondence between functional representations and SSA
is discussed in detail in [2]_. The main takeaway is that basic blocks
correspond to functions, and jumping from one block to another is done by a
tail call. Phi nodes become formal parameters of the function. The inputs to a
phi node become actual parameters (arguments) passed at the call sites in the
predecessor blocks.

Note that variable names in this module closely follow the ones used in [1]_ in
order to make it easy to compare the two algorithms.

The `process_>` functions generally take two arguments: The current
block, and the AST node to convert to ANF in the context of this block. The
`process_statement` functions will return the current block at the end of
processing (which might have changed), whereas `process_expression` functions
will return the ANF node corresponding to the value of the expression that was
processed.

    """A basic block.

    A basic block is used while parsing the Python code to represent a segment
    of code (e.g. a function body, loop body, a branch). During parsing it
    keeps track of a variety of information needed to resolve variable names.

    Attributes:
        variables: A mapping from variable names to the nodes representing the
            bound value at this point of parsing. If a variable name is not in
            this mapping, it needs to be resolved in the predecessor blocks.
        phi_nodes: A mapping from parameter nodes corresponding to phi nodes to
            variable names. Once all the predecessor blocks (calling functions)
            are known, we can resolve these variable names in the predecessor
            blocks to find out what the arguments at the call site are.
        jumps: A mapping from successor blocks to the function calls that
            correspond to these jumps. This is information that was not used in
            the FIRM algorithm; it is necessary here because it is not possible
            to distinguish regular function calls from the tail calls used for
            control flow.
        matured: Whether all the predecessors of this block have been
            constructed yet. If a block is not mature and a variable cannot be
            resolved, we have to construct a phi node (i.e. add a parameter to
            this function). Once the block is mature, we will resolve the
            variable in the parent blocks and use them as arguments.
        preds: The predecessor blocks of this block.
        graph: The ANF function graph corresponding to this basic block.
